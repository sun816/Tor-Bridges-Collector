Collecting Tor Bridges.

Why?
```
This is to show how broken Tor bridges distributions are.
Please fix your system!
P.S.: We are against oppressive regimes!

Types of pluggable transport:
```
WebTunnel bridges are a censor resistant proxies that try to imitate HTTPS traffic, based on HTTPT research.

Obfs4 bridges makes Tor traffic look random, and also prevents censors from finding bridges by Internet scanning.

Snowflake bridges are improvement upon Flashproxy. It sends your traffic through WebRTC, a peer-to-peer protocol with built-in NAT punching. 

Vanilla bridges are unobfuscated bridges.
